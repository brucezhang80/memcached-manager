Did you ever try to read all keys that are in memcached and found out that memcached have no command that allows it?

Do you miss being able to actually know what is inside your memcached server effortlessly?

I did want that, so I've built it. Check it out:

(image of menu)
- Check how much time is left for any key to expire or how much size it occupies.

(image of search)
- Find any key you want. (made in angular.js)

(terminal mode image)
- Type anything on a terminal connection directly with the memcached server, no need to telnet anymore.

(image with crud stuff)
- A CRUD for your memcached server: Create, Read, Update or Delete any key without using an archaic direct telnet connection.

All that packaged in a slick web interface, just install it and use it! It's also pluggable to any rack/rails application with -one line-.

(installing instructions, gem install memcached-manager blablabla)
